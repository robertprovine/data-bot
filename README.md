# Data-Bot
A Database Application Creator

** Robert Provine 5/7/2017 **

## What is Data-Bot?

Data-Bot is an Express project generator for creating CRUD applications. When creating a new application with Data-Bot, parameters such as the name of the application, the table names and their columns, routes and their corresponding form fields that interface with specified columns of specific table columns, are easily editable. Once all edits are made, a zip file of the Express project can be instanty downloaded. The contents of the zip include an Express project folder, full of all models, views, controllers, database migrations and source code for a fully customized, working database application straight from the download button. Database tables that include id references to other tables will also be visually expressed in the generated forms as selections instead of text input, by referencing a specified column (editable) of the reference table, making it easy and intuitive to use. The home page of the generated app will have links to all routes specified. Each route will have its own CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE functionality. Each CREATE and UPDATE will have its own custom picked fields and field names to interact with the corresponding database table columns. Each READ will have its own customized parameters to view as well. In essence, a bare bones template styled, but fully functional complex database application with as many tables and cross-referencing tables as the user wants is able to be created quickly with Data-Bot.

## Disclaimer
Data-Bot is still being developed and is not fully functional yet. The description above should work as described after front end development is complete.
